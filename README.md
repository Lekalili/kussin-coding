## Task
Develop a program that counts from 0 to 100 and prints out Hello for all numbers divisible by 3 and prints out World for all numbers divisible by 5.\
NOTE: There can only be one valid output value per line

The code should be written in one of the following programming languages:
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Rust

## Hint
The program should be as flexible as possible and reflect your skills.\
NOTE: Frameworks are allowed.

## Description & Executing the examples
The program should print out Hello for all numbers divisible by 3 and print out World for all numbers divisible by 5. It will also print 'Hello World' in two lines if the number is divisible by both numbers (3 and 5). For example, number 0 is divisible by any number (except by itself) so in this case the output will be both options.\
To run the Javascript example, simply run the **index.html** file in any browser.\
To run the PHP example, you must have a web server with PHP installed\

Open CommandPrompt and type the following:\
```cmd
C:\> php PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FOLDER\php\index.php
```

In my example it is: 
```cmd
C:\> php e:\xampp\htdocs\kussin-coding\php\index.php
```

OR

Go to the following PHP Sandbox [(Click me)](https://wtools.io/php-sandbox/bMv2) and click the button 'Execute code' to run it.\
You can also use any other PHP Sandbox online, you should only copy the code inside ***index.php** and execute it.
